Some of the main highlights:

    Build a Blockchain in the object-oriented programming style.

    Generate hashes for blocks in the chain.

    Unit Test Components of the Blockchain.

    Create an API around the Blockchain.

    Create a real-time connected peer-to-peer server.

    Implement a proof-of-work algorithm.

    Sign Transactions with cryptography and digital signature.

    Create a Transaction Pool for a real-time list of incoming data.

    Include transactions in core blocks of the chain.

What have I learned from this project : 

    Combining block and chain entities to create blockchain.

    What does ledger mean in the context of blockchains ? 

    What does distributed mean in the context of the blockchain ?

    What does a cryptocurrency need to be functional(secure blockchain, wallets, Mining) ?

    How does transactions,transaction pools work ?

    How we can implement Proof-of-Work algorithims ?

    Block Properties (timestamp, lastHash, hash, data, nonce, difficulty)

    What does genesis block mean and how it is usefull in the Block context ?

    Multiple chain validation and chosing the longest chain to be confirmed.

    How to set up a p2p server (first app to start the peer to peer server
    a later server, connecting to the original.) ?

    Hash validation via checking the corruptness of genesis block

    Socket syncronisation with blockchain and eachother

    Setting up a proof of work system with difficulty levels and setting up a rate of mining accordingly
    (Dynamic Block Difficulty)

    How does 51% attacks work ?

    ----Blockchain Part Complete----

    What is a wallet ?

    What are private and public keys used for ?

    What is signing a hash (Digital Signature) ?

    How to implement Elyptic Cryptography ?

    Transaction Updates

    Transaction Pools 

    ----Transaction Part Complete----

    Blockchain + Transaction Pool = Miners

    The nuance of Wallet Balance

    Completion of Miners and overall project

Main skills that I obtained at this project

- Getting a deeper understanding of JavaScript

- Creating projects using NodeJS

- Creating a p2p server

- Creating simple API's

- Creating unit tests using Jasmine

- A deep understanding of how blockchains work
